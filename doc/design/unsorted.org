  Perks are picked up at start and every level up from a group of 3. Perks that have never been chosen are displayed as =???= until picked. Perks are weighted by type based on level, how many perks of that type has been chosen, and how many times that specific perk has been chosen.

  Perks have multiple types:
    - General
    - Heritage
    - Background
    - Skill
    - Job
    - Specialization

Heritage and Background perks get tracked by Background. At certain level milesones, they begin applying beyond that specific Background.
General, Skill, Job, and Specialization perks get tracked by Job Specialization. At certain level milestones, they begin applying beyond that specific Specialization.
